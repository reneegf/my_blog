At the beginning of 2025 I started what I call my "Thinking Project". During the last few months of 2024, I became very aware that people around me spend a lot of time thinking and researching topics they care about, stuff that's not just interesting to them but also important for the world. I admire this and I realized I haven't really been doing it myself. In a way, I feel like I haven't been thinking enough.


So I want to change that! My plan is to pick a topic I'm interested in every month or two, dive into research, and actually form my own opinions about it. And, given that I could definitely use some improvement in my writing and making a webpage is fun, I'll post about these topics here.
