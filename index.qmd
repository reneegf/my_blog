At the beginning of 2025, I started what I call my *“Thinking Project.”* In the last few months of 2024, I realized that the people around me spend a lot of time thinking deeply. They do research on topics they care about—ideas that aren’t just interesting to them but also important for the world. I admire that, and it made me reflect on my own habits. In a way, I felt like I wasn’t thinking enough.

So, I want to change that! My plan is to pick a topic every month or two, dive into research, and either form my own opinions or break down complex ideas. And since I could use some improvement in my writing (plus, making a webpage is fun), I’ll be posting about them here.

The Thinking Project has two parts:  
**<span style="color:#515897;">Deep Dives</span>** – I explore broad, socially relevant topics I am interested in. I research, reflect, and write to clarify my thoughts. These pieces are, in a way, more personal.  
**<span style="color:#515897;">Focus Sessions</span>** – I also started science-focused discussions with friends. Whenever I present, I’ll write about it here too. These pieces are more about facts than opinions.

I’m a Mexican scientist and bioinformatician in training, currently pursuing my PhD at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. I study how diet influences cancer progression and also work on fostering diversity in STEM as Co-President of DIAS. Outside the lab, you’ll probably find me running, reading emotionally intense fiction, or hanging out with friends and family.
